Transferring implicit bamboo weaving craft knowledge to explicit architectural design application through computational design methods
<!--more-->

The craft of bamboo weaving is rapidly disappearing in industrialised cities like Hong Kong. Traditional bamboo craft products are being replaced by mass-produced inexpensive alternatives made of synthetic materials. With little market demand, there is a lack of interest in the long process of learning bamboo weaving skills as a profession, therefore the knowledge is difficult to pass down to the next generation. Consequently, the potential of adopting weaving craft into contemporary application is also diminished. 

Over the last 15 years, advance in computational design has aided the application of weaving in architecture in terms of geometry, topology, and physics. However, computational weaving using bamboo as a material and basketry weaving principles have not yet been thoroughly explored. Bamboo basket-weaving is performed by interlacing pliable long bamboo strips that hold up as a self-sustaining object without additional fasteners. There is insufficient study about the implication of unexpected structural deformation during such hand-weaving process, as forces applied will cause unusual repulsive forces.

To address the deficiency in current knowledge, the proposed research aims to understand the properties of bamboo for the purpose of weaving. The findings about its material and structural properties will be used to develop a design method for woven bamboo structures. The findings will make the craft knowledge accessible to non-craft trained designers and fabricators who are interested in bamboo weaving.
