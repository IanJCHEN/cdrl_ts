#### Introduction

Hiroyuki Shinohara is an Assistant Professor at the School of Architecture of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Before joining CUHK, he was an Assistant Professor in Architecture and Built Environment at the University of Nottingham, Ningbo.

Before joining academia, Hiroyuki practised at international architecture firms as a lead designer. At AECOM, Shanghai, he was an Associate Director and led teams in Architecture and Urbanism for integrated architecture and urban design projects. At Perkins & Will, Shanghai, he was the Director of Design Practice in charge of architectural design, quality assurance, and delivery of projects.

With diverse experiences in practice, Hiroyuki engages in teaching and academic research at CUHK. His current research direction brings together craft, material, and technology to evaluate and upgrade the use of local materials and traditional making techniques for contemporary architectural design. He also researches on type and typology and the idea of the city, examining the dominant architectural types of cities and their social implications. In his Ph.D., Hiroyuki studied Japanese architects' uses of onomatopoeias in their textual descriptions. The research points to the Japanese architects' use of the ordinal sound-based words particular to the Japanese language that results in the production of sensible and tangible spaces in Japanese architecture. The research contributes to the study of language in architecture by connecting the study of language to materiality instead of formality.
