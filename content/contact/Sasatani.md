Engineering Research Associate

Professor, Tokyo Denki University

Professor Masamichi Sasatani teaches at Tokyo Denki University. He is also a structural designer with over 25 years of practice and the project advisor for this work. His many achievements in structural design and research include studying and designing large-span wooden lattice roofs with laminating lamina. Prof. Sasatani's most iconic work is the structural design for "Minna no mori Gifu Media Cosmos" by the renowned Japanese architect Toyo Ito. The building realises a dynamic free-form roof by a structure utilising the softness of short and thin cypress materials, which form a triangular grid pattern in three plane directions. Recently, his research has focused on experimental and analytical studies on the mechanical properties and structural design methods of hybrid structures (steel, concrete, wood and other materials).
