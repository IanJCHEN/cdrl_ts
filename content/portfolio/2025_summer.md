“Weave. Pause. Move.” explores the traditional hexagonal weaving technique—commonly found in bamboo craftsmanship—and transforms it into a new architectural form. As the material is scaled up, its properties change; in response, the team conducted extensive experiments and computer simulations to develop a structural and construction system that is both visually appealing and technically feasible. The project aims to discover new applications for traditional craftsmanship.

This work was a collaborative effort between the design team and eight student volunteers. Since the construction involved participants with no prior experience, the design process also emphasized how to make the techniques accessible and easy to learn in a short time. Interestingly, the project became a platform for interaction among architects, teachers, alumni, students, craftsmen, and the public—an integral part of building community through architecture.

The structure consists of 30 to 40 bamboo slats, each made by cutting 5-meter-long bamboo poles. Although temporary in nature, the installation is lightweight and fully recyclable. The stones at the base serve as counterweights and were repurposed from leftover materials from other design exhibitions, underscoring the project's commitment to sustainability.
In terms of spatial experience, the project seeks to harmonize the unspoken pressure of a dense urban environment with the flowing rhythm of nature. Situated in the heart of a bustling city, the bamboo pavilion’s organic, porous form allows wind and light to pass through—swaying with the bay breeze, dancing above the rippling water, and casting dynamic shadows on the ground. At its center, a skylight gently opens upward, symbolizing the connection between earth and sky. It invites hurried passersby to pause, offering a moment of quiet reflection—a silent call to reawaken our awareness of the natural world and our relationship with it.
