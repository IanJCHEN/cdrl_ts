Bamboo weaving is a traditional craft commonly found in basketry or dim sum steamers. In Hong Kong, however, industrial products are gradually replacing bamboo products, and having skilled craftsmen pass on the bamboo weaving knowledge to the next generation becomes more and more difficult. To go beyond pure conservation, this project explores the technical aspect of this traditional craft and experiments with its application on an architectural scale. An installation is made for PMQ’s Hollywood Garden to showcase a new design using the traditional Kagome weaving technique.

The new work is displayed alongside documentation of the digital design process, starting from formal/structural representation and simulation to the manual craft-making of prototypes. The work is inspired by the sounds of Suzumushi (鈴虫) kept in bamboo cases, a familiar scene in suburban Japanese houses from summer to autumn, painting a refreshing and calm atmosphere. It is recreated in the pavilion through sound installation as a place for visitors to sit, rest and relax while enjoying the tactile quality of bamboo craft.
