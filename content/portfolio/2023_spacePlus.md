The two box-shaped components were fabricated out of 0.6mm thick galvanized steel sheets. The first component measures 1150 x 775 x 1300mm (LWH), while the second measures 1150 x 605 x 1300mm (LWH). These components were purposefully designed for easy attachment to a tricycle with a cargo bed height of 655mm, readily available from the local market. Inspired by the traditional custom bikes/trikes used by street vendors, the design of these two components prioritizes the ease of transportation and deployment while maintaining a human-scale proportion.

To construct the boxes, basic scissors and other simple tools were used, employing traditional folding techniques. Different folding and seaming methods, known as "bones" due to their structural significance, were utilized in various parts of the boxes to correspond with specific functions and loading conditions. The "Japanese Seam" (Pittsburg Seam) was typically used to join two sheets perpendicularly.

One of the trikes serves as a welcome booth and an information stand. By opening the cover lids, the trike transforms into a shaded area with horizontal canopies and a tabletop. The other trike serves as a display board. By horizontally unfolding the panel frames, the bulletin boards extend to 4.5m in length and serve as a space dividing element for the surrounding area. Strategically positioned at the park entrance, these folded galvanized steel trikes effectively attract the attention of passersby, contributing to the urban space and the public event.
