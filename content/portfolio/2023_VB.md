Transforming the regional traditional bamboo weaving craft on an architectural scale, we can create self-bracing woven structures with the help of digital tools.  

Moving Bamboo is a woven bamboo canopy with three footings to shelter the whole outdoor area. Bamboo strips up to 5m long can be rolled and compactly stored in crates during transportation. While the woven pavilions can have a very large span when they are unfolded. After weaving the strips to form the canopy, the crates become part of the footing, so less bamboo strips can be used.  

The pavilion can be easily assembled and disassembled with homogeneous material and the form depends on the way of weaving. There is a flexibility to reconfigure the weaving pattern and create different forms every time which allows design collaborations.
